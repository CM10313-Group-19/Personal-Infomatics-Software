## What must be produced:
  - A written report that explains:
    -  Your analysis of a PI problem
    -  Your SDLC (software development life cycle) approach 
    -  Your products (requirements, designs, tests, plans, and results)
    -  A critical analysis of your work. 
  - A short demonstration video (approximately 2 minutes) that expresses your PI concept and shows your software in operation
(your working software should be shown for at least 1 minute). Videos that run for more than 3 minutes will not be
accepted. 

### Guide to the written report:

  - Expected length of the main body of the report is 20 pages; do not exceed this limit as
additional pages will not count toward the assessment. 
  - Additional material (questionnaires, interview transcripts, details of meetings, etc.) may be included in clearly
titled appendices. 
  - Cover page, abstract, table of contents, group contribution form, appendix, and references do not count toward the page limit.
  - All sources of information should be correctly referenced and a full list of these references provided at the end of the report.

#### Suggested allocation of page budgets:

  - [x] Cover page:
    - Unit code (CM10313)
    - Title of report
    - Group name and number
    - Date
    - Table of the authors (including names, username, and degree course)
 
  - [x] Title and Abstract:
    - Single page, the first line is report title, the second line should be a comma-separated list of authors
    - Followed by an abstract of the document (approx 200 words) summarising:
      - The problem
      - Key features of your designed solution
      - Features so far implemented by your 3 completed sprints
      - Directions for further evolving your software system  

  - [x] Table of contents
    - Contains the title of each section and subsection of the report, with page numbers
    - Numbering should start from the title page
    - Indicate the authors of each section or subsection
  
  - [ ] Introduction (2 pages)
    - A description of the problem area (Personal Informatics) supported by relevant literature (See
NFR3.1 and NFR3.2)
    - What can make a PI software system effective for its users
    - A clear statement of the main idea behind your particular PI software system. 

  - [x] Agile Software Process Planning and Management (2 pages)
    - Describe how you carried out your project as an Agile process
    - How you planned and tracked your sprints
    - How Scrum meetings were used to manage the evolution of your idea and the features you decided to include in your software system.

  - [x] Software Requirements Specification (5 pages)
    - Account of how you established your detailed system requirements (building on the initial requirements).
    - A description of the specific domain of your personal informatics system, linked to the viewpoint of students as your target users.
    - Use cases to illustrate the services your PI system is intended to offer to relevant actors, including target users.
     - A set of functional and non-functional requirements for your system, organized into sensible groups and following the guidance given to you in lectures (e.g. relationships and priorities).

  - [x] Design (5 pages)
    - A set of UML models describing the low-level design of your system (class models,
sequence diagrams, etc.)
    - A justification of your chosen design. This should explicitly show how your design meets both functional and non-functional requirements, making direct reference to them and the rationale behind your design as it embodies your PI idea. Make sure you include explanatory text with your design models: the meaning of a diagram
is very rarely self-evident because it depends on an explanatory frame for interpretation. So you must make sure to express in words what you wish the reader to understand by them.

  - [x] Software Testing (Verification) (2 pages)
    - Testing plans, indicating how you planned to perform verification of your PI system. These plans should reflect your requirements and design work, and be completed before any implementation (coding) work begins.
    - Evidence of testing (test case results).

  - [ ] Reflection and Conclusion (4 pages)
    - A critique of your software system’s requirements specification, design, and testing, including what might be improved and why you feel it would be better with these changes.
    - A critical reflection on the group’s software process, including evidence of Agility in your software process, and evidence of having evolved your requirements to reflect changes in the understanding of the problem and viability of designs. 

  - [x] References
    - List of references to articles from which you have gathered information as part of your research and have cited in the body of your report.

  - [x] Final Group Contribution Form
    - The final Group Contribution Form (GCF), as described in Section 3.1.
    - Include a justification of high deviations from your group’s median level. 
    - Include as the 1st appendix of the report
 
  - [x] Other Appendices
    - Records of group meetings (minutes) as 2nd appendix
    - Transcripts of interviews  and/or other evidence of primary research as 3rd appendix
    - May include earlier design models to show the evolution of ideas as an appendix
    - Unit tests

#### Notes:
  - All pages must be numbered
  - All diagrams must be clearly labeled  with suitable headings and sub-headings 
  - Fonts in figures should be no smaller than the font in their captions. 
  - Number your sections but do not go deeper than four levels of hierarchy
