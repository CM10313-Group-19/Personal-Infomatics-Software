  - Explanation of how the code is organised <br>
    Main is the entry point of the program which creates an instance of MainFrame. MainFrame extends JFrame, and when the program is run an instance of StartPage(which extends MainGUIPanel) is added to the frame. StartPage switches between the various classes that extend JPanel to provide a GUI for logging in and creating an account. After the user logs in, MainFrame removes StartPage and adds MainPage which is the GUI for the main program (also extends MainGUIPanel). MainPage initially adds an instance of Menu where the user is able to go to any of the pages of the app (Food, Exercise, Sleep). When the user presses at button in Menu, MainPage removes the panel it is displaying and adds the newly selected panel.
