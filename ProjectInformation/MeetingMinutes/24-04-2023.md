- Thomas has finsihed goals section, adding a new page to the menu that gives the ability to add new goals. Each goal has a due date and a description of the goal.
Goals can be marked as complete or deleted. Marking a goal as complete turns it green. If the due date of a goal passes and the goal has not been marked as complete, the goal turns red.
