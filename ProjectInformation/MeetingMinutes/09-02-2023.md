  ------------------------------------------------
  *Notes:*
  - Alex A agreed to begin creating a questionnaire about what people would like out of a personal health/fitness app. Will then share with the rest of the group to discuss what questions should be asked, then use it to interview people and get primary data.
  - goal between now and next meeting is to cover all the references provided in the specification in the References folder (1-7) and create a summary about them using the .md template(in order to allow every one in the group to quickly see all the usefull information from the references without having to read them all), thinking about how they can inform us on how to make a useful personal infomatics program so we can start to come up with requirements. Aim to do 1-2 of the references each, making sure you write what you are doing in the ReferenceTracker file before you start on a reference so no one does the same thing. After doing the specification references, find another reference not listed in the specification and do the same process for that.
  - A different language to java will be used for the backend
