# Finishing sprint planning for sprint 2

While sprint 2 technically ended on 31/3/23, we will use Easter to finish of any parts from sprint 2 to be ready for sprint 3 when we get back. Hence, sprint 2 has been 'extended' for the meantime.

Think about writing parts of the report over Easter so not to fall behind schedule or other groups.
