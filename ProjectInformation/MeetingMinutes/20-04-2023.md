Starting sprint 3 today, unfinished tasks from sprint 2 have been moved to the sprint 3 kanban board which has now been created. Added the rest of our 
  requirements which haven't yet been completed to the sprint 3 backlog such as adding charts to all the sections to display data, and fully connecting the backend
to the frontend.
