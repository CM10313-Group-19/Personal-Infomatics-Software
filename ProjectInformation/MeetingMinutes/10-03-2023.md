<details><summary>Sprint retrospective</summary><p>
  
  - First sprint so far <br>
    In the sprint so far it has been slow on the development of the GUI due to unfamiliarity with the GUI library, 
    The Login and email validation is complete with unit tests being created
    The Backend has been created with storage of different types of data being implemented
    In the GUI the login page has been completed with the Sleep, Food and menu pages still being currently developed

    In the next sprint things should go more smoothly and faster as familiarity with the GUI has increased and 
    the backend can start to be linked to the frontend

    WWW:
    Backend complete
    Login validation complete
    EBI:
    GUI pages completed faster
