# Sprint retrospective

More progress has been made in sprint 2 than in sprint 1 because of increased familiarity with Java and creating GUIs. All of the main GUI pages we want to create have been created apart from the goals page. Goals will be implemented in sprint 3. Apart from goals, all places where data is entered into the program have now been completed. The only feature that has not yet been able to be implemented in sprint 2 has been adding charts to the program to visualise data. This will be the focus of sprint 3, along with adding the goals section. Additionally, the backend has now been completed with functionality for all the data we want it to be able to store, however it has not yet been connected to the front end and this task will be moved over to sprint 3.

In the next sprint we should have a completed product with all the features we wanted to implement to meet the requirements. However, we are not sure at this point if we will have time to implement compatabitly with the terra API.
