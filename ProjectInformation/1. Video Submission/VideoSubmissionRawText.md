You need to submit your video via Re:View (Panopto). Below is some guidance :  (taken from the University of Bath’s http://teachinghub.bath.ac.uk ) 

 

 

Once you have completed your video recording and all members of the team are happy with the final version then one member of the team will need to upload it to Re:View (Panopto), the University’s lecture capture system.

Allow plenty of time to upload your recording as there may be technical issues such as loss of internet connection, high demand on the Panopto server, or slow uploading times. We suggest uploading your video 48 hours before your deadline to mitigate for unforeseen technical issues. 

 

In case of any technical issues, please also make sure you have kept a saved copy of your work.
