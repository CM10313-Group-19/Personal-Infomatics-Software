# Reference 1. One Size Does Not Fit All: Applying the Transtheoretical Model to Energy Feedback Technology Design

A paper about how people are motivated differently, in the context of motivating sustainable energy usage behaviours through technology.

## Key Relevant Takeaways:
  - Information alone rarely motivates action
  - Information should change over time to match with the individuals deepening knowledge to sustain a behavior change
  - The specific values and value systems of each individual should be considered to customise the visualisations to best motivate each individual

#### One approach to motivation is providing real-time, continuous feedback
  - Feedback can be presented in different ways, e.g.:
    - Raw data
    - Personal cost
    - Environmental impact
  - But this approach is limited as they provide the same feedback to differently motivated individuals, at different stages of readiness, willingness and ableness to change. 
  - Unless the user is already motivated, feedback only informs but doesn't necessarily motivate action.

#### Transtheoretical model (stages of change):
Intentional behavior change occurs as a process:
  1. *Precontemplation* (Unaware or unwilling)
  2. *Contemplation* (Acknowledging behaviour is a problem, open to information, but may be far from making an actual commitment)
  3. *Preparation* (Aims to develop and commit to a plan)
  5. *Action* (Overtly modifying behaviour)
  6. *Maintenance, Relapse, Recycling* (Sustain behavior change)

#### Durability of behaviour change 
Durability = behavior that is self sustaining without the need for repeated interventions. To achieve this, intrinsically motivated behaviour is ideal:
  - Intrisic motivation: Doing an activity for its inherent satisfactions rather than for some seperable consequence

#### Commonly-used motivation techniques

  - Information model
    - Provides information to a problem; why it is a problem, and action steps to solve the problem
  - Positive reinforcement
    - Response is followed by the addition of a reinforcing stimulus
    - Increases likelihood that response will be repeated in similar situations.
  - Elaboration Likelihood Model
    - Proposes two routes of cognitive processing
      1. Logic, rationale, and quality of the argument
      2. Emotional persuasion, influenced by factors unrelated to the argument's validity

#### Information, Rational-Economic and Attitude Models:
  - Provide complex feedback visualizations and trends over days to months
  - Also action steps to improve behavior <br>
But limitations:
  1. **Information alone rarely motivates action**
  2. Humans have a psychological tendency to avoid non-supportive information, and may discount information that contradicts their current behaviors
  
This model can be very effective in the *preparation* and *action* stages. Also can be effective in the *maintenance* stage if the **information changes over time to match with the individuals deepening knowledge**.
  
#### Positive Reinforcement, Emotional Persuasion and Values
  Example app - Ubigreen (transportation behaviors)
  - Uses a series of emotionally persuasive icons as positive reinforcement, as behaviour gets greener, icons progress further (ecosystem improves)
  - Icons also represent auxillary benefits (e.g. piggybank - money)
  - An improvement would be to consider the specific values and value systems of each individual, e.g. person A values exercise and fitness over money, so visualisation can provide personalised feedback
  - Limitation: extrinsic nature of positive iconic reinforcement
    - Viewed as a game
    - Negatively impacts intrinsic motivation
    - May lead to less durable behavior change
    - Target demographic should influence design, e.g. Ubigreen was targeted at already very green individuals, so more likely in the *action* or *maintenance* stages of TTM, where intrinsic motivation is required for long-term success.
  
### Best motivational framework
  
#### Precontemplation:
  Goal: Present information in moderation for individuals to acknowledge their current behavior as problematic
  - Personalised feedback that acknowledges benefits and consequences of individuals behaviour, presented in relation to what the specific individual values
  - Provide personalised feedback of a variety of small energy actions that would have a positive impact on their behaviour
  
### Contemplation:
  Goal: Tip balance in favour of change
  - Provide personal feedback on the pros of improving behaviour emphasizing improvement to quality of life in relation to what they value
  - Remind individuals of their new attitude (improving behaviour) and inform them of the discrepancy between their attitude and the corresponding behaviour, and encourage change.
  - Provide encouragement for small energy actions to encourage larger actions in the future
  - Link the technology to a community and encourage the individual to browse and read information of the experiences of other users in the community
