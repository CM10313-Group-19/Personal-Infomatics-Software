# Reference 4. A stage-based model of personal informatics systems

Describes what people want out of a personal informatics system, how a system should be designed and barries that people face using similar systems

## Key Relevant Takeaways:
  - Personal informatics systems are made to allow users to reflect on the data
  - Previously people used pedometers and notebooks to keep track of data, some used excel.
  - People like to use metrics like how much would they walk if they didn’t use a bike or car
  - People like the ability to export data if they want to go to another service if there isn’t currently a functionality they would like
  - Data should be automatically collected from devices to avoid estimation from manual input and to avoid missing time periods 
  - People like organised data so they can easily find, retrieve and view related data
  - People like having goals set / things to do next (basically suggestions)
  - The system should be flexible to support different information inputs / other systems 
  - The system could be multifaceted e.g. tracks data on physical, financial and media usage data allowing greater potential of data shown / correlations
  - Barriers need to be identified so that we can create the system around them so user experience is better
