# Reference 8. Using Mobile & Personal Sensing Technologies to Support Health Behavior Change in Everyday Life: Lessons Learned

The article discusses four lessons learned from the development and study of UbiFit Garden, a mobile phone-based system for encouraging physical activity and healthy behavior change.

## Key Relevant Takeaways:
  - The first lesson is that supporting persistent activation of health goals can be a powerful means of fostering health behavior change.
  - The second lesson is that the system can substantially influence how the individual engages in health behavior change, and should therefore encourage an extensive range of healthy behaviors.
  - The third lesson is that the system should focus on longer-term patterns of activity, rather than short-term changes.
  - The fourth lesson is that the system should facilitate social support as an optional but not primary motivator. The article emphasizes that these lessons are important considerations when designing mobile systems for encouraging health behavior change.
