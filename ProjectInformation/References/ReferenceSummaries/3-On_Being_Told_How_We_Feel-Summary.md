Investigates if people's emotions can be influenced by seeing the output of emotion-inferring algorithms

## Key Relevant Takeaways:
  - Young adults are highly interested in automatic stress and emotion tracking. Nevertheless, they have little awareness of existing tools. Furthermore, their motivations to use such systems suggest that they perceive systems as potentially offering objective, accurate interpretations of personal experiences.
  - Users are significantly influenced by algorithm feedback. Participants with negative feedback report increased symptoms of anxiety and are more negative in their usage experience. In contrast, we see some protective effects of positive feedback which reduces anxiety and improves task assessments.
  - Warns that people developing PI systems should take caution in presenting definitive meanings to emotion-sensing algorithms. 
  - Describes new design approaches that:
   1. Reduce deferral effects by promoting more accurate mental models and collaborative interpretations of data
   2. Strategically leverage beneficial effects to aid emotion management during challenging tasks.
