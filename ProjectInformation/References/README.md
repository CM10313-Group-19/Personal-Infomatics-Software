# Reference Tracker

*Note:*
  - Put your reference summaries in the ReferenceSummaries folder
  - Before working on a reference, check the README to make sure no one has already summarised that referance
  - Once you start reading a reference, strikethrough it on the list
  - If you add a reference not given in the specification, add it to the reference folder and number it, then add the Harvard reference so it can be referanced in the written report.
